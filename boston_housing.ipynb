    "Machine learning models are basically mathematical functions that represent the relationship between different aspects of data. Models can have parameters some can be learnt during the trainig phase ans some other which called **hyperparameters** must be specified outside the training procedures such as decision trees depth ot number of leaves.\n",
    "This type of hyperparameter controls the capacity of the model, i.e., how flexible the model is, how many degrees of freedom it has in fitting the data. Proper control of model capacity can prevent **overfitting**, which happens when the model is too flexible, and the training process adapts too much to the training data, thereby losing predictive accuracy on new test data. So a proper setting of the hyperparameters is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search is one of the algorithms used for tuning hyperparameters; true to its name, picks out a grid of hyperparameter values, evaluates every one of them, and returns the winner. For example, if the hyperparameter is the number of leaves in a decision tree, then the grid could be 10, 20, 30, …, 100.\n",

    "Even if we split the data, our knowledge while tuning a model's parameters can add biases to the model, which can still be overfit to the test data. Therefore, ideally we need a third set the model has never seen to truly evaluate its performance. The drawback of splitting the data into a third set for model validation is that we lose valuable data that could be used to better tune the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to separating the data is to use cross-validation. Cross-validation is a way to predict the fit of a model to a hypothetical validation set when such a set is not explicitly available. There is a variety of ways in which cross-validation can be done. These methods can be divided into two groups: exhaustive cross-validation, and non-exhaustive cross-validation. Exhaustive methods are methods which learn and test on all possible ways to divide the original data into a training and a testing set. As such, these methods can take a while to compute, especially as the amount of data increases. Non-exhaustive methods, as the name says, do not compute all ways of splitting the data.\n",

    "**K-fold cross-validation** in an example of exhaustice method, which consists of randomly partitioning the data into k equal sized subsets. Of these, one subset becomes the validation set, while the other sets are used for training the model, and the process is executed k times, one for each validation subset. The performance of the model, then, is the average of the performance of model in each of the k executions. This method is attractive because all data points are used in the overall process, with each point used only once for validation."

Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `max_depth` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects learning and testing errors.
